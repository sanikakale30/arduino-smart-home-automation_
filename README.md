# Arduino Smart Home Automation with Motion and Light Control

## Overview
This project automates a home light using a **PIR Motion Sensor** and **LDR** with Arduino.  
It turns the light ON when motion is detected **and** the ambient light is low, and automatically turns it OFF after a set delay.

## Components
- Arduino Uno / Nano
- PIR Motion Sensor
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- 10kΩ Resistor
- Relay Module (to control AC light)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard


## How it Works
1. Upload the code from Arduino_Sketch/smart_home.ino to your Arduino UNO.
2.Connect all components 
3.Move in front of the PIR sensor in dim light to test the system.
